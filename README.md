# Amazon-Fine-Foods-Review-Analysis-and-Modelling
In this case study I have perform Exploratory data analysis, data preprocessing, Feature engineering, model building etc on Amazon Fine Foods Reviews dataset. In each and every step of this project, lots of several sub-steps are included. Built various model like KNN, Naive Bayes, Logistic Regressin, Support Vector Machines, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost & various Clustering Algorithms etc with many featurization tecnique like bow, tfidf, word2vec, average word2vec, tfidf word2vec etc and also performed hyperparameter tuning for each and every model and plotted various plot for checking model stability, convergence of hyperparameter value, underfitting, overfitting etc.
